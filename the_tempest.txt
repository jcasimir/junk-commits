THE TEMPEST.


ACT I.

SCENE I. _On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder
and lightning heard._
  _Enter _a Ship-Master_ and _a Boatswain_._
_Mast._ Boatswain!
_Boats._ Here, master: what cheer?
_Mast._ Good, speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely, or
we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.    [_Exit._
  _Enter _Mariners_._
_Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s
whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
  _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO,
  and others._
_Alon._ Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?
Play the men.
_Boats._ I pray now, keep below.                                    10
_Ant._ Where is the master, boatswain?
_Boats._ Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:
keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.
_Gon._ Nay, good, be patient.
_Boats._ When the sea is. Hence! What cares these                   15
roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble
us not.
_Gon._ Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
_Boats._ None that I more love than myself. You are a
Counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,           20
and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope
more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you
have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin
for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good
hearts! Out of our way, I say.    [_Exit._                          25
_Gon._ I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks
he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:
make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth
little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case          30
is miserable.    [_Exeunt._
  _Re-enter Boatswain._
_Boats._ Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!
Bring her to try with main-course. [_A cry within._] A
plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather
or our office.                                                      35
  _Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO._
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o’er, and
drown? Have you a mind to sink?
_Seb._ A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!
_Boats._ Work you, then.                                            40
_Ant._ Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker.
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
_Gon._ I’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship
were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched
wench.                                                              45
_Boats._ Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off
to sea again; lay her off.
  _Enter _Mariners_ wet._
_Mariners._ All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
_Boats._ What, must our mouths be cold?
_Gon._ The king and prince at prayers! let’s assist them,           50
For our case is as theirs.
_Seb._                   I’m out of patience.
_Ant._ We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp’d rascal,--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
_Gon._                  He’ll be hang’d yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it,                        55
And gape at widest to glut him.
  [_A confused noise within:_ “Mercy on us!”--
  “We split, we split!”-- “Farewell my wife and children!”--
  “Farewell, brother!”-- “We split, we split, we split!”]
_Ant._ Let’s all sink with the king.                                60
_Seb._ Let’s take leave of him. [_Exeunt Ant. and Seb._
_Gon._ Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a
dry death.    [_Exeunt._                                            65

SCENE II. _The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell._
  _Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA._
_Mir._ If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer’d                              5
With those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish’d!
Had I been any god of power, I would                                10
Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow’d and
The fraughting souls within her.
_Pros._                        Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There’s no harm done.
_Mir._              O, woe the day!
_Pros._                           No harm.                          15
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,                          20
And thy no greater father.
_Mir._                   More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
_Pros._                          ’Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. --So:
                                [_Lays down his mantle._
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.              25
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely order’d, that there is no soul,
No, not so much perdition as an hair                                30
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.
_Mir._                        You have often
Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp’d,
And left me to a bootless inquisition,                              35
Concluding “Stay: not yet.”
_Pros._                The hour’s now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not                   40
Out three years old.
_Mir._             Certainly, sir, I can.
_Pros._ By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
_Mir._                        ’Tis far off,
And rather like a dream than an assurance                           45
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?
_Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?                             50
If thou remember’st ought ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.
_Mir._                         But that I do not.
_Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and
A prince of power.
_Mir._           Sir, are not you my father?                        55
_Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir
And princess, no worse issued.
_Mir._                       O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?                    60
Or blessed was’t we did?
_Pros._                Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence;
But blessedly holp hither.
_Mir._                   O, my heart bleeds
To think o’ the teen that I have turn’d you to.
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.                  65
_Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call’d Antonio,--
I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself,
Of all the world I loved, and to him put
The manage of my state; as, at that time,                           70
Through all the signories it was the first,
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother,                              75
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?
_Mir._             Sir, most heedfully.
_Pros._ Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, whom to advance, and whom                         80
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,
Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state
