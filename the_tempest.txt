and lightning heard._
  _Enter _a Ship-Master_ and _a Boatswain_._
_Mast._ Boatswain!
_Boats._ Here, master: what cheer?

we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.    [_Exit._

_Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s
whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

  and others._
_Alon._ Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?
Play the men.
